"# xml2j-gen" 

This is the code generator that goes with xml2j (core).
Since the code generator relies on the Saxon XSLT and XQuery Processor (SAXON 6.5.5), you'll need to get it: http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/saxon/saxon6-5-5.zip and include the saxon.jar to your build path. For your convenience I also included it in the libs folder.

The core can be found under: 
https://github.com/lolkedijkstra/xml2j-core.git
